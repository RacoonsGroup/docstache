#Docstache

_Documentation is on pause until I finish up basic functionality.  But thanks for checking it out!_

## Features

* Mustache style data interpolation into Microsoft Word .docx files
  * This includes loops, and conditional blocks
* Merging together multiple documents (documents are joined by a page break)
* No more hassles with Word splitting up your tags across multiple XML tags.  We gotcha.
* Error detection for word documents, just in case we don't gotcha.
